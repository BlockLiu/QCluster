## QCluster in ns2

This folder contains the codes and scripts used in our simuluation for QCluster. 
Our simulation is based on [Network Simulator (NS) 2.34](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsnam/files/allinone/ns-allinone-2.34/).
For convenience, we put our codes into two folders:
- `srpt_las_ddl` contains the codes for SRPT (Shortest Remaining Processing Time first), LAS (Least Attained Service), and Deadline-Aware Scheduling
- `fairqueuing` contains the codes for Fair Queuing

Please refer to the README in each folder for detail.
